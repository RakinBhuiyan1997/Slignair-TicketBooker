# SlingAir!

## Introduction

Slingair is a ticket booking project which uses a primary build of React.js in the front-end. The back-end is engineered with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

## Goals of this Project

The goal of this project was to practice the implementation of Node, Exprees, and MongoDB. This project also allowed me to properly connect and engineer proper funtionality between the front-end and the back-end.

## Screenshots 

Here is the flight select area where you can choose your flight.

Once a flight is chosen, it will show you what available seats are there. Un-available seats will be greyed and unclickable.

Once the reservation is made, it will redirect to the confirmation page. You may also click on the reservation link above and enter the auto-generated Id from the confirmation page and it will show the user their flight details.

## Languages Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- React.js
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDb

## What I've learned and enjoyed

- Enjoyed learning proper MongoDB syntax and how to properly use different methods within it to properly organize data.
- Enjoyed learning different response codes and what they communicate.
- Practiced implementaion of connecting the front-end and back-end.
- De-bugging backend from viewing terminal console.logs and tracing it back to the original problem code.
- Learned that data sent from the back-end must be extrapolated to be used in the front-end.

## What improvements I would make

- Create a profile section where users can edit their reservation details.
- Create a homepage where users can select from different airlines. 
- Learn Mongoose and implement its schema into teh backend.
